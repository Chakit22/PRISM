## Realistic Rendering of Hands

1. Worked on a project named ’Realisitic Rendering of Hands’.The goal of the
project was to investigate the role of synthetic data in 3D hand pose estimation
(HPE) in third-person point of view.

2. Have generated a synthetic dataset of around 1k Images of different hand
gestures on various backgrounds, textures.

3. Have also generated a GIF shwoing the different hand gestures formed.

## Images with Different Textures

1. A Python code was run on the above input images which basically involved the process in the below metioned steps:
  - Adding an alpha channel to the input images using the OpenCV Library.
  - Adding a background to the RGBA (Red,Green,Blue,Alpha) Images.
